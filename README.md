# Dotfiles

## Hello!
My name is Balázs Szélig. I'm 14 years old and I love coding and ricing Arch Linux. So I'm gonna share my dotfiles with you.

## The story and the previews
I love retro (but modern) things. So I've come up with an idea: My Linux could look like an arcade room. So I've searched for an image for the wallpaper and I found a very good one. Then I was write the scripts for alacritty, rofi, polybar, picom, neovim and i3wm. So this is the result:

## The dotfiles
You can access the dotfiles on [this link](https://github.com/SzeligBalazs/dotfiles) or you can clone it directly with this command:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/SzeligBalazs/dotfiles.git
```

## You'll need:

- i3wm
- i3gaps (i3-gaps-rounded-git)
- alacritty
- polybar
- rofi
- neovim
- picom


So how do you satisfied with my dotfiles? Let me know in the comments.
And that was my first post on this site. Thank you for your attention! Bye!
